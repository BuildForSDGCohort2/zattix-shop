# Capstone Project - HTML&CSS Module

> This is my Capstone Project for Microverse Software Development Program.
My goal was to build a page similar to [this one](https://www.behance.net/gallery/24796463/ZATTIX), from [Behance](https://www.behance.net/). Two pages have been built: a home page and a search results page. Their screenshots are presented below:

#### This is a screenshot of the home page:
